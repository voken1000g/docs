Referrals System
================

Help improve the vision network ecosystem,
strengthen the network, promote consensus,
and **earn ETH**.

We believe that a larger user base
that understands the project's value
is the foundation of a healthy ecology.

So we've built a multi-levels referral system
that rewards both the referrer and referee when a user reserves VokenTB tokens in VokenTB sales.

And the referral relationships will always be available,
including the :ref:`sale_early_bird` and the :ref:`sale_public`.


Early-Bird referral reward: 22%
-------------------------------

The :ref:`early_bird_sale_contract` has a 10-levels referral system.

During the Early-Bird Sale,
**22% of sales revenue** will be used as rewards:
