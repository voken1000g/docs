Limited sales
-------------

We hope that more users will hold VokenTB,
which is more conducive to the entire ecosystem.

Therefore, during the early bird sales phase,
there is a purchase amount limit for each address:

==============  =============
Sales progress  Payment limit
==============  =============
< 50%           0.1 - 1.0 ETH
>= 50%          0.1 - 0.5 ETH
==============  =============

Only one purchase per address is allowed.

then you can get an additional 1% - 10% random bonus (paid in VokenTB).

- 10% released instantly
- 90% released according the process of the Public-Sale
